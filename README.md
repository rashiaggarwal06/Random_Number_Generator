It is a mini project we can say, that is, Random Number Generator. 
I have made it using some basic concepts of python programming language, used import Random (that is used to generate a random value) and loops.
It can take any number as user's guess but I have given it a limit to generate any number that is between 1 and 100.
You can use it easily, its easy to understand and implement.
